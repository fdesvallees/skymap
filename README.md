# skymap
Sky Map based on D3 and Jason Davies' "Rotate the World" example.

Displays a projection of the night sky (stars and constellation lines only - no solar system yet).
The star database derives from the astronomy nexus (http://astronexus.com/hyg) - only stars brighter than magnitude 5 are displayed.
The constellation lines come from the PP3 program (http://pp3.sourceforge.net/)
